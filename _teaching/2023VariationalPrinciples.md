Course Description:
"The course mainly deals with functionals (and functional derivatives) and enables one to find
the path that minimises the distance between two points on a given surface (a geodesic), the path of
a light ray that gives the shortest travel time (satisfying Fermatâ€™s Principle), or the minimum energy
shape of a soap film. Many fundamental laws of physics (in Newtonian mechanics, relativity, electromagnetism or quantum
mechanics) can be expressed as variational principles in a profoundly elegant and useful way that brings
underlying symmetries to the fore."
