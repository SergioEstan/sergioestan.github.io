Course Description:
"The techniques developed in this course are of fundamental importance throughout physics and applied
mathematics, as well as in many areas of pure and applicable mathematics.
The first part of the course considers stationary points of functions on R^n and extends the treatment
in Part IA Differential Equations to deal with constraints using the method of Lagrange multipliers;
e.g. this allows one to determine the stationary points of a function on a surface in R^3.
The second part of the course deals with functionals (and functional derivatives) and enables one to find
the path that minimises the distance between two points on a given surface (a geodesic), the path of
a light ray that gives the shortest travel time (satisfying Fermatâ€™s Principle), or the minimum energy
shape of a soap film.
Many fundamental laws of physics (in Newtonian mechanics, relativity, electromagnetism or quantum
mechanics) can be expressed as variational principles in a profoundly elegant and useful way that brings
underlying symmetries to the fore."
